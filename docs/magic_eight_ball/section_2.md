# Project: **Magic eight ball**


### Writing the code

##### (Sec. 1.3) Write answers

When you shake the Sense HAT, we want it to give an answer. In this section
you will write the answers that the magic eight ball can give.

If you look at the section, you'll see the following code:

```python
answers = []
```

You'll have to add the answers as *strings* in the list, for example:

```python
answers = ["yes", "no"]
```

A string is a piece of text enclosed within either double " or single ' quotation
marks. The strings in the list have to be separated by commas (**,**).

This is an empty list, that you should fill with possible answers. Here are
some typical magic eight ball answers that you can use:

- Outlook good
- Yes
- No
- Ask again later
- Better not tell you now
- Concentrate and ask again
- Don't count on it

But instead of using these, you should try to come up with your own!
