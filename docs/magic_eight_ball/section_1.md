# Project: **Magic eight ball**


### Introducing the project

The first thing you should do is open the _skeleton code_ for the project.
In programming, skeleton code means code that only has the basic elements of a
program. It is up to you to fill in the rest!

You can find the skeleton code on Trinket, here:
<a href="https://goo.gl/bzqdNi" target="_blank">https://goo.gl/bzqdNi</a>

**If you can, you should also create and account and log in to Trinket. This will
allow you to save the Trinket projects. Otherwise you have to copy the code on
to your computer to save it.**

On Trinket, you'll be able to test your code on a *virtual* Sense HAT, before you try
your code on the real thing.

As you might see, the skeleton code is split up into sections, divided by the headlines.
For example:

```python
#### 2. Code section
```

This guide will go through the various sections (not necessarily in order), and
help you write your code. **Very important note:** *You should add the code in the specified section in your skeleton code as you follow this guide.*

The next part of this guide will explain the stuff that's
already in the skeleton code when you first open it.

##### Explanation of the skeleton code

Before we get on to the coding, it's worth looking over the *skeleton code* and make
sure you are familiar with it.

The first few lines in the script are:

```python
#### 1.1 Import libraries

import sys
sys.path.insert(1,'/home/pi/Go4Code/g4cSense/skeleton')

from sense_hat import SenseHat
from senselib import *
```

Without going into detail, these lines are called *import statements*. They are
used to *import* code from other Python files into your own file. This is useful
because you can use other people's code to simplify your own.

The next part of the code (Sec. 1.2) creates some important *Objects* (don't worry
if you're not sure what that means) that we'll use in the later on.

Sec. 1.3 is where you will write all the messages that the eight-ball can give.

Sec. 2 is where you will write the code that checks if the Sense HAT is shaken.
