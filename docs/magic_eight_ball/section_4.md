# Project: **Magic eight ball**


#### Finished!

If it's all done, correctly, the game should now work! Don't worry if it doesn't,
things often go wrong in programming. Errors in code are usually called *bugs*. If
you have a bug in your code, you'll have to *debug* it!

If it works, congratulations! You can either move on to another project or try
to come up with new things to add to the current project. Use your creativity!
You can discuss any ideas you have with a supervisor.
