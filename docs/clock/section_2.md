# Project: **Clock**


### Introducing the project

The first thing you have to do is open the file you'll be programming in. In the
_clock_ project folder, open the file called _clock.py_. The code in this file
is not enough to actually run Clock, you'll have to fill in the blanks! In
programming, we call this _skeleton code_.

As you might see, the skeleton code is split up into sections, divided by the headlines.
For example:

    #### 2. Code section

When you set about your task you should let these headlines guide you on what to
do in each part of the code. The next part of this guide will explain the stuff that's
already in the skeleton code when you first open it.

Note: The text starting with a '#' is called a comment. These comments explain what the code does
to programmers and people reading the code, but is ignored by the computer.

##### Coding in Trinket
The skeleton code for this project is on Trinket at this link: <a href="https://trinket.io/python/cab6a53e6d">Skeleton Code for Clock</a>.


There, you'll be able to test your code on a *virtual* Sense HAT, before you try
your code on the real thing. Go on to the website, and create an account.


##### Explanation of the skeleton code

The first few lines in the script are:

    #### 1.1 Import libraries

    from sense_hat import SenseHat
    from datetime import datetime


Without going into detail, these lines are called *import statements*. They are
used to *import* code from other Python files into your own file. This is useful
because you can use other people's code to simplify your own.

The next part of the code (Sec. 1.2) creates some important *Objects* (don't worry
if you're not sure what that means) that we'll use in the later on.

Sec. 2 is where all the main coding will take place. This is the *Main Loop*
