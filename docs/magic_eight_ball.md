## Description

In this project we'll be creating a *Magic 8 ball* using the Sense HAT. If you've never seen one
before, you might remember it from Toy Story: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFOracFClBg" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFOracFClBg</a>.

It's a very simple toy: You ask it a question, you shake the ball (or Sense HAT),
and it'll give you an answer.
